\subsection{A FIR filter based delay of 30ms}
has the equation:
\begin{equation}
y[n] = x[n] + \alpha x[n - delay_s]
\end{equation}
Where $x[n]$ is the input, $y[n]$ the output, $\alpha$ is some dampening
coefficient and $delay_s$ is the delay in number of samples
corresponding in a delay of $delay$ seconds, where
\begin{equation}
delay_s = \mbox{round}(f_s \cdot delay )
\end{equation}
and $f_s$ is the sampling frequency.

This gives the transfer function:
\begin{equation}
H(z) = \frac{\alpha z^{-delay_s} + 1}{ 1 }
\end{equation}
