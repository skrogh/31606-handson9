\subsection{ Granma rolling with Maadlab }
My bored grandmother fires up \emph{Matlab} and generates a linear sweep from
$50Hz$ to $5kHz$ with a sampling frequency of $5kHz$.

\subsubsection{ What I  expect to hear }
Assuming \emph{Matlab} and my soundcard likes eachother and can upsample and
filter away any frequencies above half the sampling frequency, I expect to hear
a cosine sweep from $50Hz$ to $2500Hz$ and then (with opposite phase) back again
from $2500Hz$ to $0Hz$. This sweep has been illustrated in fig.
\ref{3-1-sweep-fold-brick}.

\stdfignoscale{3-1-sweep-fold-brick}{ Linear sweep from
$50Hz$ to $5kHz$ with a sampling frequency of $5kHz$.
Each color represents the frequency response at a
different time, starting with blue and mooving to red. }{3-1-sweep-fold-brick}

Now I know that is probably not the case (by listening this is quite easy to
check). Neither \emph{Matlab} or my soundcard has a brickwall lowpass filter at
$2500Hz$, so what I hear is actually multipe sweeps moving up and down. The
audible range of the first $25\%$ of the sweep is illustrated in fig
\ref{3-1-sweep-fold-nofilt}. Or with a zero order hold \emph{DAC (digital to
analog converter)} :
\ref{3-1-sweep-fold-zero}.

$50Hz$ to $5kHz$ with a sampling frequency of $5kHz$.

different time, starting with blue and mooving to red. }{3-1-sweep-fold-nofilt}

\stdfignoscale{3-1-sweep-fold-zero}{ Linear sweep from
$50Hz$ to $5kHz$ with a sampling frequency of $5kHz$.
Each color represents the frequency response at a
different time, starting with blue and mooving to red. }{3-1-sweep-fold-zero}

\subsubsection{ What my parrents expected }
was of course to actually hear a sweep from $50Hz$ to $5kHz$, because they do
not know about the nyquist theorem and frequency folding. If I was to explain
this to them, I'd probably tell them it's like that effect when you photograph a
checkered shirt and get those wavy patterns instead.

\subsubsection{ Explanation }
The reason for this frequency folding is sampling in the time domain, which
leads to preodicity in the frequency domain. This leads artefacts if care is not
taken to ensure that all frequencies stay inside their ``period'' in the
frequency spectrum, but it also leads to artefacts if one is not careful when
outputting the signal through ex. a \emph{DAC}.
