\subsection{ Granma rolling with Maadlab }
My bored grandmother fires up \emph{Matlab} and generates a linear sweep from
$50Hz$ to $5kHz$ with a sampling frequency of $5kHz$.

\subsubsection{ What I  expect to hear }
Assuming \emph{Matlab} and my soundcard likes eachother and can upsample and
filter away any frequencies above half the sampling frequency, I expect to hear
a cosine sweep from $50Hz$ to $2500Hz$ and then (with opposite phase) back again
from $2500Hz$ to $0Hz$. This sweep has been illustrated in fig.
\ref{3-1-sweep-fold-brick}.

Now I know that is probably not the case (by listening this is quite easy to
check). Neither \emph{Matlab} or my soundcard has a brickwall lowpass filter at
$2500Hz$, so what I hear is actually multipe sweeps moving up and down. The
audible range of the first $25\%$ of the sweep is illustrated in fig
\ref{3-1-sweep-fold-nofilt}. Or with a zero order hold \emph{DAC}:
\ref{3-1-sweep-fold-zero}.

\subsubsection{ What my parrents expected }
was of course to actually hear a sweep from $50Hz$ to $5kHz$, because they do
not know about the nyquist theorem and frequency folding. If I was to explain
this to them, I'd probably tell them it's like that effect when you photograph a
checkered shirt and get those wavy patterns instead.
