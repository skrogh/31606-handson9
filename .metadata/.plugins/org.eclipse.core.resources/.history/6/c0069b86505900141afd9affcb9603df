\subsection{A FIR filter based delay of 30ms}
has the equation:
\begin{equation}
y[n] = x[n] + \alpha x[n - delay_{samples}]
\end{equation}
where $x[n]$ is the input, $y[n]$ the output, $\alpha$ is some dampening
coefficient and $delay_{samples}$ is the delay in number of samples
corresponding in a delay of $delay$ seconds, where $delay_{saples} =
\mbox{round}(f_s \cdot delay )$
